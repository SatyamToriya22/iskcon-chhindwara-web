ISKCON Chowpatty is home to a loving community of practicing Hare Krishna devotees and is dedicated to the practice of bhakti-yoga or loving service to Krishna, the Supreme Person (God). We are a branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a worldwide spiritual movement founded by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in New York City in 1966.\n \n Due to the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to close our gates for our visitors in the interest of public health and safety. But we can’t wait to see you all once again come and feel blessed seeing the main Darshan, go-around the complex seeing the Laxmi Narayan temple, the Vrindavan forest and the diaroma exhibits. Visiting for any of the daily aratis or joining us for the numerous festivals we celebrate. We also conduct a variety of courses, seminars and workshops. In fact, there’s something for everyone – the kids, the youth, the families. We also invite you to dine at our international restaurant, celebrate your occasion at the temple or join us for any of our tours. Together, let’s enhance the spiritual dimension of our lives!",
